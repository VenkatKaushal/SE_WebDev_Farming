###Overview
This project aims to develop a system that predicts both the quality and quantity of crop yield based on multiple factors, including soil quality, rainfall, location, and weather conditions. The system incorporates data from government sources and integrates weather forecasts to enhance prediction accuracy.

###Features

- Data Collection:

collected information for diffrent 14 crops and all details.

- Yield Prediction:

Simulates the crop’s growth cycle, predicting yield over time.
Provides insights into crop quality based on varying conditions.
3D Simulation:

Visual representation of the crop’s development, showcasing the ripening process and potential decay under different scenarios.
Pages
Predictor Page: Allows users to input data and view yield predictions.
Simulator Page: Offers a 3D simulation of the crop growth cycle.
Home Page: Overview of the project and navigation to other pages.
Info Page: Details about the project, its purpose, and methodology.
