### Overview
- In this project, we aim to develop a system that predicts both the quality
and quantity of crop yield based on multiple factors such as soil quality,
rainfall (3 days), location, and weather conditions. Soil quality data will
be sourced from government websites (e.g., soilhealth.dac.gov.in),
while the user will provide rainfall and location inputs. The system will
integrate weather forecasts to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Based on the collected data, our solution will simulate the crop’s growth
cycle, predicting its yield over time. Furthermore, the project will
feature a 3D simulation of the crop’s development, providing a visual
representation of its ripening process or potential decay under varying
conditions.
